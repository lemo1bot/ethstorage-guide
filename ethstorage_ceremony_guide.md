# ðŸš€ How I Contributed to EthStorage's Trusted Setup Ceremony

Hey crypto fam! ðŸ‘‹ Just finished contributing to EthStorage's trusted setup ceremony and wanted to share how easy it was. Here's my step-by-step guide:

## What is EthStorage?
EthStorage is a Layer 2 that lets you store data on-chain for games, socials, and AI. This ceremony makes sure the whole system stays secure and decentralized.

## My Setup Process (took me about 10 minutes):

### 1. Prerequisites âœ…
- GitHub account (at least 1 month old)
- At least 1 public repo
- Follow 5+ accounts and have 1+ follower
- Stable internet connection

### 2. Installation Steps:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone t.co/Cgng6PM8ds.git

# Create working directory
mkdir ~/trusted-setup-tmp && cd ~/trusted-setup-tmp

# Install the CLI tool
npm install -g @p0tion/phase2cli

# Authenticate with GitHub
phase2cli auth
```

### 3. The Authentication Part:
- Run `phase2cli auth`
- Visit https://github.com/login/device
- Copy the auth code from terminal
- Paste it on GitHub and authorize
- Boom! You're in! ðŸŽ‰

### 4. Start Contributing:
```bash
# For background running (recommended)
screen -S ceremony
phase2cli contribute -c ethstorage-v1-trusted-setup-ceremony
```

## What Happens Next:
- You'll join a queue (might take hours)
- When it's your turn, you'll be asked for random input
- Just hit Enter for random, or type anything you want
- The process runs automatically
- You'll get a completion message when done! ðŸŽŠ

## Pro Tips:
- Use `screen` so it keeps running if you close terminal
- If connection drops, just restart the same command
- The ceremony runs until August 22, 2025
- After completion, clean up with `phase2cli clean && phase2cli logout`

## Why This Matters:
This ceremony ensures EthStorage's zk-SNARK circuits are secure. Every contribution adds randomness, making the system more decentralized and trustworthy.

## My Experience:
Honestly, it was super smooth! The CLI tool is well-made, and the process is straightforward. Took me about 10 minutes to set up, then just waited for my turn in the queue.

The best part? You're helping secure the future of on-chain data storage! ðŸŒŸ

**Ceremony Status**: Running until August 22, 2025
**Time Investment**: ~10 minutes setup + queue wait time
**Difficulty**: Easy peasy! ðŸ¥§

If you're into crypto and want to contribute to something meaningful, this is a great way to get involved!
